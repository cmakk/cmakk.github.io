Mini-Project: Insure Landing Page
# Frontend Mentor - Insure landing page solution

This is a solution to the [Insure landing page challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/insure-landing-page-uTU68JV8). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects. 

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Javascript (hamburger navigation menu)
- Handlebars
- Font Awesome
- Responsive design

### What I learned

I used Chrome DevTools in order to view my screen at very different sizes and I realized that my previous projects were not very responsive to small mobile screens. This time, I was able to make the font size much more responsive to screen size and I was able to change the navigation bar to a hamburger-style menu for smaller screens. I also learned how to use CSS Grid in order to overlap elements (e.g. the hero image).
